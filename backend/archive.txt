STORY 1 — File Upload via UI
    As a user, I should be able to upload a large CSV file (up to 500,000 products) directly through the application’s user interface.
    The UI should display a clear and intuitive file upload component.
    During the upload process, the UI should show a real-time progress indicator (e.g., percentage, progress bar).
    If duplicate products exist, the system should automatically overwrite based on SKU, treating the SKU as case-insensitive.
    The SKU must remain unique across all records.
    Products may be marked as active or inactive (even though this field is not part of the CSV).
    The upload flow should be optimized for handling large files efficiently while remaining responsive.

STORY 1A — Upload Progress Visibility
    As a user, I should be able to see the upload progress directly in the UI in real time.
    The progress should dynamically update as the file is being processed.
    The UI should display visual cues like a progress bar, percentage, or status messages (e.g., “Parsing CSV”, “Validating”, “Import Complete”).
    If the upload fails or encounters errors, the UI should clearly show the failure reason and provide a retry option.
    The technical implementation may rely on APIs (e.g., SSE, WebSockets, or polling), but the focus is on providing a smooth, interactive visual experience.

STORY 2 — Product Management UI
    As a user, I should be able to view, create, update, and delete products entirely from a web interface.
    The interface should support:
    Filtering by SKU, name, active status, or description.
    Paginated viewing of product lists with clear navigation controls.
    Inline editing or a simple modal form for creating/updating products.
    Deletion with a confirmation step.
    Minimalist, clean design — even a simple HTML/JS frontend is sufficient as long as it demonstrates all functional capabilities.

STORY 3 — Bulk Delete from UI
    As a user, I should be able to delete all existing products directly from the UI.
    This operation must be protected with a confirmation dialog (e.g., “Are you sure? This cannot be undone.”).
    The UI should display success/failure notifications after the operation.
    This feature should be responsive and provide visual feedback during processing.
    STORY 4 — Webhook Configuration via UI
    As a user, I should be able to configure and manage multiple webhooks through the application’s user interface.
    The UI should allow adding, editing, testing, and deleting webhooks.
    It should display webhook URLs, event types, and enable/disable status.
    There should be visual confirmation of successful test triggers (e.g., response code, response time).
    The webhook processing should remain performant and not degrade overall application responsiveness.
